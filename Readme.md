## The Parent Hood

The Parent Hood is a web application for Parents to ask questions and answer other parents' questions.  It is designed as a QA Forum where parents can vote up/down answers according their usefulness just like with other forums such as in StackOverflow.com.

The Parent Hood is built in AngularJS with Restangular.  Parse.com is providing the backend for the application.  The app also uses Foundation for the UI.  jQuery is also being utilized as well as Underscore.js and Modernizer.js.

Be sure to run bower install and npm install in the console to retrieve all the dependencies in the source code.

This is the final web application developed at the Iron Yard.
